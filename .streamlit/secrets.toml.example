# - Do NOT commit real tokens or endpoint URLs to version control.
# - Create a local `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (ignored by git) and fill in
#   environment-specific values there, or configure secrets directly in
#   Streamlit Community Cloud.
#
# The app also supports reading these values from environment variables; when
# both are present, Streamlit secrets take precedence.
